# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pixel Penalty

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A graphic video game of a penalty shootout you could play. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I am planning for there to be a menu screen to start and pick a country to play with of one of the options, and then theres a bar to determine the power of the ball and placement of the ball when you kick it into the net, and there will be a 40/60 chance possibly of the goalie saving the ball.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I've attempted to create my first ever video game software.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A passionate interest of mine, I used to play games like these a lot during class in middleschool and highschool, so it woudl be pretty cool if I completed to create my own.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The game will include multiple rounds of penalty kicks, a scoreboard system, background music or sound effects, and I hope to create some cool animation movement effects of the goalie.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The new skills I will need to acquire is the graphics creating and adding sprites as I never really did it before on a software but only on simple websites similar to code.org, etc. So hopefully I learn this all smoothly and it goes well.
