# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I was thinking of doing a soccer penalty shootout game or a 1v1 game similar to games on popular websites I grew up playing like coolmath games. It would have a lobby screen to pick a team and then shoot a penalty on the goalie.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

No

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I also searched up some ideas and found a youtube video with a similar layout if I can use that as inspiration?
Any other ideas or comments I should add?
